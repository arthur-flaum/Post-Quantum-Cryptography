For the comparison you have to install the dependencies from the repositories like this: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. <br>
Or you can clone the repositories from here [Kyber-py](https://github.com/GiacomoPope/kyber-py) and [Dilithium-py](https://github.com/GiacomoPope/dilithium-py) that were used for the comparison, and put it into the project.
